  <h1>Hello! My name is Alex Jaouiche</h1>
  <p>I made this using HTML/Atom. I learned it in a week so this might not be the best, but I'm very proud of it.</p>
  <p>Here are some other things I can do (with varying degrees of capability):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crochet</li>
      <li>Speak french</li>
      <li>Paint</li>
      <li>Understand a modicum of cell and molecular biology</li>
      <li>Play basketball</li>
      <li>Communicate in ASL</li>
      <li>Design research studies</li>
      <li>Data analysis</li>
      <li>Use Adobe apps</li>
      <li>Public health!</li>
    </ul>
  <p>I also went to Malaysia for year. I kept a pretty good documentation of it
